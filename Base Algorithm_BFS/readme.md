## Please run below test cases and results are provided in attached files
> utility.py : this file contains queue and Stack classes to be used in Search Algorithms

> SearchAlgo.py : This file actually implements A Star algorithms

> TaskExecution.py: This is main driver file to be run for algorithms

 > path_to_goal: the sequence of moves taken to reach the goal

> cost_of_path: the number of moves taken to reach the goal

> nodes_expanded: the number of nodes that have been expanded

> search_depth: the depth within the search tree when the goal node is found

> max_search_depth:  the maximum depth of the search tree in the lifetime of the algorithm

> running_time: the total running time of the search instance, reported in seconds

> max_ram_usage: the maximum RAM usage in the lifetime of the process as measured by the ru_maxrss attribute in the resource module, reported in megabytes
